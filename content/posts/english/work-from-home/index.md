## 1. Create a dedicated workspace

Set up a designated area in your home where you can work without distractions.
This could be a spare room, a corner of your living room, or even a closet that you convert into a mini-office.

## 2. Stick to a schedule

Just because you're working from home doesn't mean you can't have a routine.
Set specific hours for work and stick to them as much as possible.
This will help you stay focused and avoid procrastination.

## 3. Take breaks

It's important to take regular breaks throughout the day to stretch your legs, get some fresh air, or just clear your mind.
This will help you stay energized and focused when you return to work.
